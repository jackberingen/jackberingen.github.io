# Jack Beringen - Website / Portfolio

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/df780d62-f059-4d70-940f-90a1cded7d9c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jackberingen/deploys)

> My main website, where I showcase work that i've done and completed projects. Created using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react). This was initially hosted using GitHub Pages, however, since I had to manually copy build files to the master branch every time I wanted to update the site, i've migrated to [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Building ###
This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to manage depdencies. After downloading, you can clone this repo and run `yarn install` in the base directory (i.e. where the package.json is situated) to download the packages. Then, run `yarn start` and you're good to go.

### Credits ###
I use a number of packages throughout my website. Here's a consolidated list of them:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react): for the main layout / structuring of the website.
- [react-pixi-fiber](https://github.com/michalochman/react-pixi-fiber): for rendering using [pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/) within React.
- [react-tilt](https://github.com/jonathandion/react-tilt): for a React implementation of tilt.js which gives the *litty* tilt effect within the portfolio page.
- [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group): to provide hooks required for the nice CSS animations (via the [animated](https://github.com/animatedjs/animated) package) for page transitions.
